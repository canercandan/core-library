/** @defgroup Logging Logging
 * @ingroup Utilities

 Global logger for EO.

 Here's an example explaning how to use Logger:
 \code
 #include <core_library/core_library>

 using namespace core_library;

 int	main(int ac, char** av)
 {
 // We are declaring first an overload of Parser class using Logger
 // component.
 ParserLogger	parser(ac, av);

 // This call is important to allow -v parameter to change user level.
 make_verbose(parser);

 // At this time we are switching to warning message and messages
 // which are going to follow it are going to be warnings message too.
 // These messages can be displayed only if the user level (sets with
 // setlevel function) is set to warnings.
 logger << warnings;

 // With the following file function we are defining that
 // all future logs are going to this new file resource which is
 // test.txt
 logger << file("test.txt") << "In FILE" << std::endl;

 // Now we are changing again the resources destination to cout which
 // is the standard output.
 logger << std::cout << "In COUT" << std::endl;

 // Here are 2 differents examples of how to set the errors user level
 // in using either a string or an identifier.
 logger << setlevel("errors");
 logger << setlevel(errors);

 // Now we are writting a message, that will be displayed only if we are above the "quiet" level
 logger << quiet << "1) Must be in quiet mode to see that" << std::endl;

 // And so on...
 logger << setlevel(warnings) << warnings << "2) Must be in warnings mode to see that" << std::endl;

 logger << setlevel(loggerging);

 logger << errors;
 logger << "3) Must be in errors mode to see that";
 logger << std::endl;

 logger << debug << 4 << ')'
 << " Must be in debug mode to see that\n";

 return 0;
 }
 \endcode
